## Reporting a Vulnerability

<!---

Use this section to tell people how to report a vulnerability.

Tell them where to go, how often they can expect to get an update on a
reported vulnerability, what to expect if the vulnerability is accepted or
declined, etc.

-->

**Please do not report security vulnerabilities through public GitHub issues.**

Instead, please send an email to [dev.tenshiamd@gmail.com](mailto:dev.tenshiamd@gmail.com).

You should receive a response within 24 hours. If for some reason you do not, please follow up via email to ensure that I received your original message. 

Please include the requested information listed below (as much as you can provide) to help me better understand the nature and scope of the possible issue:

  * Type of issue (e.g. buffer overflow, SQL injection, cross-site scripting, etc.)
  * Full paths of source file(s) related to the manifestation of the issue
  * The location of the affected source code (tag/branch/commit or direct URL)
  * Any special configuration required to reproduce the issue
  * Step-by-step instructions to reproduce the issue
  * Proof-of-concept or exploit code (if possible)
  * Impact of the issue, including how an attacker might exploit the issue

This information will help me triage your report more quickly.
